tbPrivateDiary stores encrypted, time-stamped diary entries in a file in your home directory, private_diary.pdl

It uses blowfish and a user-supplied password to encrypt the entries.

If you forget your password you will lose your diary entries.

After all, "only YOU have the key to your private diary."

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

It builds on Qt 5.5 C++ GUI framework, targeted at Linux platform.  I have not used it on Windows.


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
To build, you need the Qt 5.5 development libraries:

in src directory, you need to tell qmake that you want the name to be tbPrivateDiary,
otherwise, it will create a src.pro and build a program called src, so:

First:
$>qmake -project -o tbPrivateDiary.pro

Then, add the following two lines near the top of the .pro file 
QT += gui
QT += widgets

Then, run:
$>qmake
$>make

This will build tbPrivateDiary executable in src directory.
